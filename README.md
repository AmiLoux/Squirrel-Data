Difficulty: easy

Now let's analyze some funny data. Did you know that New York City collects census data . . . about squirrels? Yep, they even have a website.

This dataset from 2018 contains data about 3000+ squirrel sightings, such as age, fur color, activities, interaction with humans, etc.

We can think of many questions:

What was the date for the highest number of sightings?
Who runs more, adults or juveniles?
Which squirrels are more willing to approach humans, and in which areas?
Do squirrels who approach humans eat more frequently?
We can also group squirrels by location, fur color, and age and see if they are connected to squirrels' activities.
Even if you don't find any correlation, it's still funny to analyze, and may even make a future employer smile â€” and positive reactions are what we want from employers!
